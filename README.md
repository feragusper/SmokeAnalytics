üíªRequirements and Getting started
----------------------------------
Java 17 is required.

> :warning: **This project won't compile unless a few credentials are provided**

In order to build it locally:

- Add `google.auth.server.client.id=\"GOOGLE_AUTH_SERVER_CLIENT_ID\"` to local.properties (used by
  firebase google auth).
- Add proper `google-services.json` (download it from firebase project) to app module (used by
  firebase firestore and google auth).

- Use `./gradlew assemble` to build it, or run it in Android Studio.
- Use `./gradlew test` to run the unit test on your local host.

üèóÔ∏èArchitecture
--------------
Based on Clean Architecture. Using MVI, Use Cases and Repositories.
Modules are split by feature. App module is almost empty, it's just the glue between the modules.

Features can be found in the `features` module. Each feature has its own module, and it's split in 3
layers:

- `domain`: Contains the business logic of the feature. It's the core of the feature, and it's
  agnostic of the platform.
- `data`: Contains the implementation of the repositories defined in the domain layer. It's the
  layer that knows how to get the data from the platform.
- `presentation`: Contains the UI of the feature. It's the layer that knows how to display the data
  to the user.

Shared libraries can be found in the `libraries` module. Following the same structure as the
features, each library has its own module, and it's split in 3 layers if necessary.

--------------------

- Kotlin
- Architecture Components
- Kotlin Coroutines/Flow

‚öôÔ∏èCI
----
Github Actions are used for automating several recurrent processes:

- Integration: Run unit tests. It's triggered on every PR.
- Deployment Artifact: Build and deploy a new artifact to Github Packages. It's triggered on every
  push to master.
    - There should always be available a latest debug build for downloading
      at https://github.com/feragusper/SmokeAnalytics/actions/workflows/deployment.yml
- Deployment Playstore: Build and deploy candidate releases to Playstore in closed beta channel. Can
  be executed manually with proper credentials.
